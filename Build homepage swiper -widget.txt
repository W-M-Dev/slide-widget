I have a client who would like a homepage swiper / widget that is the same as https://www.brushcreekranch.com/

See attached homepage-view.png and mobile-view.png screenshots.

I'm looking to hire someone to build this for me.

The site is being built with foundation.js and jquery.
So feel free to use those frameworks.

Deliverable from you:
- An HTML page where I can easily replace the images and text as needed.
- Text will overlay the images just like on brushcreekranch site.
- Ability to have 3 or more slides.
- Must be responsive like brushcreekranch
- Must work like brushcreekranch

I've attached 3 zip files. Each zip file contains image that can be used for the slides.

Please respond with a total budget that you think this will cost.
